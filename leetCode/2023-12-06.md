### DESCRIPTION

Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000






### SOLUTIONS

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int k = n / 7;
        int F = 28;
        int L = 28 + (k-1) * 7;
        int arithmeticSum = k * (F+L) / 2;
        int monday = 1 + k;
        int finalWeek = 0;
        for (int day = 0; day <  n%7;day ++){
            finalWeek += monday + day;
        }
        return arithmeticSum + finalWeek;
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        int monday = 1;
        while (n > 0){
            for (int day = 0; day <  min(n,7); day ++){
                ans += monday + day;
            }
            n -= 7;
            monday ++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
