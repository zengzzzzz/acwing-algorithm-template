### DESCRIPTION

Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator

There is a directed weighted graph that consists of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the given array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, edgeCosti] meaning that there is an edge from fromi to toi with the cost edgeCosti.

Implement the Graph class:

Graph(int n, int[][] edges) initializes the object with n nodes and the given edges.
addEdge(int[] edge) adds an edge to the list of edges where edge = [from, to, edgeCost]. It is guaranteed that there is no edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
int shortestPath(int node1, int node2) returns the minimum cost of a path from node1 to node2. If no path exists, return -1. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
 

Example 1:


Input
["Graph", "shortestPath", "shortestPath", "addEdge", "shortestPath"]
[[4, [[0, 2, 5], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 3]]], [3, 2], [0, 3], [[1, 3, 4]], [0, 3]]
Output
[null, 6, -1, null, 6]

Explanation
Graph g = new Graph(4, [[0, 2, 5], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [3, 0, 3]]);
g.shortestPath(3, 2); // return 6. The shortest path from 3 to 2 in the first diagram above is 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total cost of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return -1. There is no path from 0 to 3.
g.addEdge([1, 3, 4]); // We add an edge from node 1 to node 3, and we get the second diagram above.
g.shortestPath(0, 3); // return 6. The shortest path from 0 to 3 now is 0 -> 1 -> 3 with a total cost of 2 + 4 = 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1)
edges[i].length == edge.length == 3
0 <= fromi, toi, from, to, node1, node2 <= n - 1
1 <= edgeCosti, edgeCost <= 106
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph at any point.
At most 100 calls will be made for addEdge.
At most 100 calls will be made for shortestPath.

```c++
class Graph {
public:
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adjList;
    Graph(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        adjList.resize(n);
        for (auto& edge : edges){
            adjList[edge[0]].push_back(make_pair(edge[1],edge[2]));
        }
    }
    
    void addEdge(vector<int> edge) {
        adjList[edge[0]].push_back(make_pair(edge[1],edge[2]));
    }
    
    int shortestPath(int node1, int node2) {
        int n  = adjList.size();
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<vector<int>>> pq;
        vector<int> costForNode(n, INT_MAX);
        costForNode[node1] = 0;
        pq.push({0, node1});
        while(!pq.empty()){
            int currCost = pq.top()[0];
            int currNode = pq.top()[1];
            pq.pop();
            if(currCost > costForNode[currNode]){
                continue;
            }
            if(currNode == node2){
                return currCost;
            }
            for( auto& neighbor : adjList[currNode]){
                int neighborNode = neighbor.first;
                int cost = neighbor.second;
                int newCost = currCost + cost;
                if (newCost < costForNode[neighborNode]){
                    costForNode[neighborNode] = newCost;
                    pq.push({newCost, neighborNode});
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
