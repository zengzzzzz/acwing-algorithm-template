### DESCRIPTION

Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
Example 2:

Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

### SOLUTION

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        vector<int> first = vector(26, -1);
        vector<int> last = vector(26, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
            int curr = s[i] - 'a';
            if (first[curr] == -1) {
                first[curr] = i;
            }
            last[curr] = i;
        }
        int  ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
            if(first[i] == -1){
                continue;
            }
            unordered_set<char> between;
            for (int j = first[i] + 1; j < last[i]; j++){
                between.insert(s[j]);
            }
            ans += between.size();
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
